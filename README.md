# Buy-Stuff-Back-End

## Description

This project was created build the back end for an e-commerce site. I used Express.js API and configured it to use Sequelize to interact with the MySQL database.

This project includes a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. 

To use it the application, you must use the MySQL2 and Sequelize packages to connect the Express.js API to a MySQL database and the ideally add in a dotenv package to use environment variables to store sensitive data.
